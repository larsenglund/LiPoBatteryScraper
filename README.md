# LiPo battery scraper

Scrapes [AliExpress](http://www.aliexpress.com/) and [HobbyKing](http://www.hobbyking.com/) for Lithium Polymer batteries to find the ones with the most bang (watthours) for the buck or gram :)

Aliexpress scraper pushes data to a graph at [plot.ly/~englund/0](https://plot.ly/~englund/0). This graph was generated mid february 2016.

HobbyKing scraper generates two list, sorted by [watthours per SEK](https://github.com/larsenglund/LiPoBatteryScraper/blob/master/hk_batt_scrape/data_by_watthourspergram.json) and [watthours per gram] respectively. These lists where generated mid february 2016.
